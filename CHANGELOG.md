# Changelog

As the tooling part of this repository is not intended to get released, all
notable changes to this project will be documented in each application tray's
directory.

You can list (and possibly read) them using the following shell command:

```bash
$ find apps -maxdepth 2 -name CHANGELOG.md
```
